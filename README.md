# esp8266-lua
Collection of Lua scripts for running on the esp8266 wifi module on the node-mcu firmware

You can find the node-mcu firmware here: https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware

Some of this work was inspired by Julian Illet and his work with the ESP8266 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvIoBFLj2Xo)

### Notes about the files:

`init.lua` and `pwm_led.lua` are likely identical. `init.lua` is bootstrapped and ran automatically when uploaded to the module. I use it just for that.

`snippets.lua` is not actually usable code, but minor pieces that I have referred back to whilst learning to program in Lua.

Anyways, enjoy! Fork, pull request, whatever! It's all free :smile:
